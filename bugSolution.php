The solution involves careful consideration of data types and using more robust methods for handling arrays.  Here's how to address the issues demonstrated in `bug.php`:

1. **Consistent Key Types:** Use consistent key types (either all integers or all strings) to avoid confusion and ensure predictable behavior.  If you need mixed-type keys, consider using associative arrays or objects.

```php
// Using consistent integer keys
$myArray = [];
$myArray[1] = 10; 
$myArray[2] = 20;

//Using consistent string keys
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = 10;
$myArray["2"] = 20;
```

2. **Improved `isset()` and `empty()` usage:** Be mindful of the distinct behavior of `isset()` and `empty()`. For example, to check if a variable is set and not null or an empty array/string, use `isset()` and the `!empty()` combination.

```php
if (isset($var) && !empty($var)) {
    // The variable is set and not empty or null
}
```

3. **Iterate Carefully:** If order is essential when iterating through arrays with mixed or non-integer keys, consider using `ksort()` or other sorting methods before the loop to enforce a specific key order.

```php
ksort($myArray);
foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    // Process items in sorted key order
}
```

By adhering to these best practices, you can significantly reduce the chances of encountering these subtle yet impactful PHP array-handling issues.
